# FunProgramming
This project includes C# versions of the data structures from Chris’s book.
These are implemented as static functions, to closely resemble the book’s version.
These are meant to be used as a companion when reading the book. This allows one to fire up the samples, in a debugger, and see how they work. It also allows one to test the performance to see how the stack up with other structures.

From the book:
>Okasaki, Chris. *Purely Functional Data Structures.* 
>Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge UP, 1998. 34-37. Print.
