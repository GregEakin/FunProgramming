# FunProgramming
This project includes C# versions of the data structures from Chris’s book.
These are implemented as static functions, to closely resemble the book’s version.
These are meant to be used as a companion when reading the book. This allows one to fire up the samples, in a debugger, and see how they work. It also allows one to test the performance to see how they stack up with other data structures.
